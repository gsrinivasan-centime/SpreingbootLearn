I am a beginner towards experience with springboot framework. But i have knowledge on components of microservice architecture and desgn.

I am about to give an interview projecting myself as a 3 years experienced backend engineer with experience with springboot.

I am preparing for this interview.
I want to do backward learning with through help.
I want you to help me with building an application with two microservices for an online bookstore application.

Now, the application should help me quickly learn the below areas of a microservices architecture. 
-- Two Microservices with thier own GET, POST, PUT, DELETE calls and having their own mysql databases.
-- Maintian separation of concerns between microservice and database.
-- Microservice interaction with database using hibernate.
-- liquibase scripts for maintaing database changes and rollbacks.
-- Use of REDIS for GET / POST calls or other purposes that i dont know. You teach me the other uses of REDIS. one eg for caching using redis and application-level caching each.
-- Kafka for CDC events, consumer and producer implementations.
-- Contract testing between microservice. Junit test cases for pasing sonar qube.
-- Teach me about idempotency, Circuit Breaker, Encryption decryption of users phone numbers in DB, 
-- Asynchronous Processing batch processing - Cron jobs
-- The application should expose a swagger doc. You will teach me how u implemented it.


Teach me how you build it by maintaining separate markdown files for each area. seggregate the markdown files based on the below topic.
-- Springboot
-- Hibernate
-- database
-- liquibase
-- Redis
-- Kafka
-- Swagger
-- Design patterns
-- Testing

Provide any flowcharts and uml diagrams, mind map diagrams if possible.
